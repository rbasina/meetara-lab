# MeeTARA Lab Scripts - Organized Structure

## 🛠️ Script Organization

This folder contains system integration and validation scripts organized by purpose:

```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run complete system integration
python 01_integration/meetara_complete_integration.py

# Validate system alignment
python 02_validation/meetara_complete_alignment.py

# Check system status
python 03_utilities/system_status.py
```

## 📊 Integration Features

### Complete System Integration
- **62 Domain Support**: All healthcare, business, education, creative, technology, daily life, and specialized domains
- **10 Enhanced Features**: TTS, emotion detection, intelligent routing, GGUF factory, training orchestration, monitoring, security, domain experts, utilities, configuration
- **Trinity Architecture**: 90% efficiency, 20-100x speed improvement, 504% capability amplification

### Validation & Testing
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All components and integrations
- **Quality Metrics**: 101% validation score target
- **Performance Verification**: Speed and cost optimization validation
- **Compatibility Testing**: Cross-platform and cross-domain compatibility

## 🔧 Configuration

Scripts use centralized configuration from:
- `config/trinity-config.json` - Main system configuration
- `config/trinity_domain_model_mapping_config.yaml` - Domain mappings
- `config/safety-first-domain-mapping.yaml` - Safety configurations

## 📈 Monitoring

Real-time monitoring includes:
- Integration progress tracking
- System health monitoring
- Performance metrics collection
- Error detection and reporting

## 🔄 Execution Flow

1. **Integration Phase**: `01_integration/meetara_complete_integration.py`
2. **Validation Phase**: `02_validation/meetara_complete_alignment.py`
3. **Utilities Phase**: `03_utilities/` scripts as needed

## 📋 Legacy Files Cleanup

The following redundant files have been organized:
- Integration scripts consolidated in `01_integration/`
- Validation scripts consolidated in `02_validation/`
- Utility scripts organized in `03_utilities/`
