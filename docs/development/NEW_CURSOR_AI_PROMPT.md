# MeeTARA Lab - Complete Cursor AI Handoff Prompt

## Project Overview
I'm building MeeTARA Lab - a Trinity Architecture AI system for 504% intelligence amplification. This is an evolution of my existing TARA Universal Model project.

## Project Locations
- **NEW**: MeeTARA Lab at `G:\My Drive\meetara-lab` (Google Drive auto-sync enabled)
- **REFERENCE**: Existing TARA Universal Model at `C:\Users\rames\Documents\tara-universal-model`
- **MEMORY BANK**: `C:\Users\rames\Documents\tara-universal-model\memory-bank\` (6 core files for context)

**IMPORTANT**: Read the memory-bank files first to understand the current project context, then build MeeTARA Lab as the next evolution.

## Architecture Understanding
- **TARA Universal Model** = GGUF Factory for all domains (60+ domains)
- Creates optimized GGUF files that MeeTARA frontend consumes
- MeeTARA frontend uses these GGUF models to support humans with AI intelligence
- **MeeTARA Lab** = Enhanced factory with Trinity Architecture for 504% amplification
- **Goal**: Same GGUF output but 20-100x faster training + cost optimization

## Current Status
- MeeTARA Lab structure created: trinity-core/, cloud-training/, model-factory/, intelligence-hub/, deployment-engine/, notebooks/, cost-optimization/, research-workspace/
- Existing TARA project has 6 successful models trained, currently running batch2 daily life training
- GGUF creation pipeline exists and works - need to accelerate it with GPU cloud training
- **ALL ENHANCED FEATURES MUST BE PRESERVED AND ENHANCED**

## Trinity Architecture to Implement
1. **Arc Reactor Foundation** (90% efficiency + 5x speed) - GPU-optimized GGUF training
2. **Perplexity Intelligence** (context-aware reasoning) - Multi-domain understanding  
3. **Einstein Fusion** (504% amplification) - Advanced model fusion for better GGUF quality

## Existing Project Context
- Current training: batch2 daily life domains (12 domains) - slow on CPU (302s/step)
- Successful batch1: 6 health/wellness models trained with optimal parameters
- Training pipeline: scripts/tara_universal_pipeline.py (creates GGUF files)
- Domain mapping: configs/domain_model_mapping.yaml
- Proven settings: batch_size=2, seq_length=64, lora_r=8, max_hours=2
- GGUF creation: Working pipeline that MeeTARA frontend depends on

## Goal
Create Google Colab Pro+ optimized GGUF factory that's 20-100x faster than current CPU training with cost optimization (<$50/month). Same GGUF output quality but massively accelerated production. **PRESERVE ALL EXISTING ENHANCED FEATURES**.

## Key Requirements
- Maintain GGUF compatibility with existing MeeTARA frontend
- **PRESERVE ALL 10 ENHANCED FEATURE CATEGORIES** listed above
- Reference existing TARA architecture and successful patterns
- Leverage proven training configurations from batch1 success
- Google Drive Desktop integration for seamless sync
- Google Colab Pro+ compatibility (T4/V100/A100 GPU support)
- Cost monitoring and auto-shutdown features
- Smart package management for cloud environments
- Enhanced GGUF quality through Trinity Architecture
- Integrate ALL existing features: TTS, Emotion Detection, Intelligent Router, etc.

## Immediate Tasks
1. Read memory-bank files to understand current GGUF factory context and ALL FEATURES
2. Create trinity-core/ components leveraging existing successful GGUF patterns + ALL FEATURES
3. Build cloud-training/ GPU orchestrator based on existing pipeline but GPU-accelerated + ALL FEATURES
4. Create notebooks/ for Google Colab GGUF training + ALL FEATURES
5. Implement cost-optimization/ monitoring for efficient GGUF production + ALL FEATURES
6. **ENSURE ALL 10 ENHANCED FEATURE CATEGORIES are preserved and enhanced**
7. **CREATE the cloud-optimized-domain-mapping.yaml file** with the YAML content above

## Final Goal
The end goal is the same GGUF files that MeeTARA frontend needs, but produced 20-100x faster with Trinity Architecture intelligence enhancement, while preserving ALL existing enhanced features like TTS Manager, Emotion Detection, Intelligent Router, Universal GGUF Factory, Training Orchestrator, Monitoring & Recovery, Security & Privacy, Domain Experts, Utilities & Validation, and Configuration Management.

**This is actually BETTER than local training** - faster, cheaper, legally cleaner, AND preserves all enhanced features!

Please start by reading the memory-bank files for context, then continue building MeeTARA Lab at `G:\My Drive\meetara-lab` with Trinity Architecture focus while preserving ALL enhanced features.
