## Deployment Environments

### Staging Environment (`staging/`)
- **Testing Ground**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Integration Testing**: Full system integration tests
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
- **User Acceptance Testing**: UAT environment

### Production Environment (`production/`)
- **Live Deployment**: Production-ready deployments
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Quick rollback procedures
- **Health Monitoring**: Production health checks

## Deployment Pipeline

### Staging Pipeline
1. **Code Merge**: Merge to staging branch
2. **Build**: Automated build and packaging
3. **Deploy**: Deploy to staging environment
4. **Test**: Automated testing suite
5. **Validate**: Manual validation and approval

### Production Pipeline
1. **Staging Approval**: Staging environment approval
2. **Build**: Production build and packaging
3. **Deploy**: Blue-green deployment to production
4. **Smoke Test**: Production smoke tests
5. **Monitor**: Post-deployment monitoring

## Deployment Configurations

### Staging Configuration

environment: staging
replicas: 1
resources:
  cpu: 2
  memory: 4Gi
  gpu: 1
features:
  debug: true
  monitoring: basic
  logging: verbose
```

### Production Configuration

```

## Deployment Scripts

### Staging Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging
python deployment/staging/deploy.py --version latest

# Run staging tests
python deployment/staging/test_suite.py

# Validate staging deployment
python deployment/staging/validate.py
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production (blue-green)
python deployment/production/deploy.py --version v1.2.0 --strategy blue-green

# Rollback production deployment
python deployment/production/rollback.py --version v1.1.0

# Health check production
python deployment/production/health_check.py
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Deployment Monitoring
- **Deployment Status**: Real-time deployment status
- **Performance Metrics**: CPU, memory, GPU utilization
- **Error Rates**: Application error rates and logs
- **Response Times**: API response time monitoring

### Alerting Rules
- **Deployment Failures**: Immediate alerts for failed deployments
- **Performance Degradation**: Alerts for performance issues
- **Error Spikes**: Alerts for unusual error rates
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Alerts for resource constraints

## Security and Compliance

### Security Measures
- **Encrypted Communication**: All deployment communication encrypted
- **Access Control**: Role-based deployment access
- **Audit Logging**: Complete deployment audit trail
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security scanning

### Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR**: Data protection compliance
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data compliance
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability compliance
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Configuration Backups**: Deployment configuration backups
- **Database Backups**: Application database backups
- **Code Backups**: Application code backups
- **Infrastructure Backups**: Infrastructure as code backups

### Recovery Procedures
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to specific point in time
